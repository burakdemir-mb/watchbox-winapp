# Watchbox (WinForms)

Watchbox is a lightweight movie tracker desktop app built with WinForms and SQLite.

## Features
- Add / browse movies
- Portable demo: creates a local SQLite DB on first run

## Download
Go to **Releases** and download the latest zip (e.g. `Watchbox-v1.0.0-win-x64.zip`), then extract and run `watchbox.exe`.

## First Run (Portable DB)
On first run, the app creates:
`Data/watchbox.db`
next to the executable.

## Notes
- This is a student project / demo build. Covers are for demo/educational use.
- If you run the app from a protected folder (e.g. Program Files), Windows may block DB creation. Extract the zip to a writable folder (Desktop/Downloads) first.
